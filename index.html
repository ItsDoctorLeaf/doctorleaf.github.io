            <p>No Legged Larry is a game I made for the Indie Dev Game Jam #3. I made it in around 3-4 days with the theme of “One tool, many uses”. I managed to implement that theme with a shotgun/rifle that you use to move around, shoot zombies and do everything. Whilst I did not place too high overall, I focused a lot more on the artwork and ambience of the project.</p>

            <p>The pressure is a game where you are in a submarine sinking to the bottom of the ocean! You realise that the primary reinforcement of your ship is buckling under pressure. Your only chance is to repair it constantly. You use a variety of tools to repair damage and cracks. This game was for Indie Dev Game Jam #1. I placed higher in this one, but I had a smaller scope for the game concept.</p>

            <p>This is a Minecraft Java plugin where you create your own Roleplay characters. It was made to be used for a server, which never ended up being created. In this plugin, you can create your own custom roleplay characters with names and genders. You can search for people's real name and roleplay names and can ban certain phrases from being used as RP names.</p>

            <h5><a onclick="location.href='https://github.com/ItsDoctorLeaf/ChaosPlugin'">Chaos Plugin</a></h5>
            <p>The chaos plugin is inspired by the GTA V chaos mod. I wanted to create a similar sort of chaotic event, whilst making it easy to use. The chaos plugin doesn't use mods, and instead runs server side, making it easy to implement and work well for multiplayer. I created over 40 custom events that range from spawning a couple of enemies, summoning lighting around the player, and explosions... lots of explosions.</p>

            <p>Money Bot is an economy bot that I made for Discord, it's not currently public as it is a work in progress. It uses json files to store people’s currency and it allows people to trade money with each other, as well as have moderators manage different purchases.</p>
