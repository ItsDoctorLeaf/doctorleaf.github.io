        <p>My name is George, and I am a Games Developer. I have been programming for ~3 years and have learnt languages
            such as C#, Javascript. Recently, I began to use C++ for games and app development. I have also begun to
            create discord bots using Node.js and javascript as well as MineCraft plugins with Java.</p>

            <h1>The Pressure</h1>
            <h3>Don't let it get to you...</h3>
            <p>
                The pressure is one of my most recent game projects. It's a game where you are in a submarine sinking to
                the bottom of the ocean! You realise that the primary reinforcement of your ship is buckling under
                pressure. Your only chance is to repair it constantly. You use a variety of tools to repair damage and
                cracks. This game was made in a few days for a gameJam challenge.

            <h1>Poison Control</h1>
            <h3>Stay toxic.</h3>
            <p>
                Poison control was another game that I made for a Jam in which I had 72 hours. It was a game themed upon
                poison, as such I wanted to make a rage game. Confusing puzzles, Painful controls, A long map with big
                risks. Checkpoints are available along the way if you complete small puzzles.

            <h1>Birds with Guns 2</h1>
            <h3>It's like the first one but sorta better.</h3>
            <p>
                After making the original birds with guns, I felt that something was lacking. As-such, I created this remake. It has more weapons, and more boss attacks. The movement is refined and I removed the sniper because I felt it added minimal content. There are now more weapons and abilities such as teleporting, which are necessary due to all the new difficult attacks and enemies! Good luck...

            <h1>Plants VS Zombies : Pollution</h1>
            <h3>A remake with a twist.</h3>
            <p>
                This game was made when I got aseprite. I was trying to test my artistic abilities, so I made this game!
                It is not playable as I like not being sued atm, and don't want to risk it, however, you can find a
                play-through on my YouTube! In this game, the plants die after different amounts of time, this means
                that you have to have a constant replacement for each plant ready. There are a few different types of
                plants that are more useful in different scenarios. For example, the pea shooter is good for single
                enemies whilst the lightning reed is good for massive hoards. Each plant has different amounts of
                health, so they will all die at different times. This is an infinite game with no set ending.

            <h1>Birds with Guns</h1>
            <h3>It's birds, but with guns!</h3>
            <p>
                This is the original birds with guns! It was made for a game Jam with 72 hours to create the greatest game you can! This one was much harder than the sequel, and had fewer guns, however, it's got more of a charm to it (If you look past the wild art-style). In this game, there is a sniper that means you can't stop moving, as to follow with the limitation of the jam.

            <h1>Shade</h1>
            <h3>Shadows are waiting!</h3>
            <p>
                This game was created for another 72 hour game Jam. The theme was Shadows and I decided to make a game where you have to avoid the lights. With your limited bullet capacity, you must destroy the minimal amount of lanterns to get around the obstacles. In post, I did realise how drifty the controls are, however I believe that it's not too much of a problem, as the game is still fun, with a rather comedic ending.

        <h3>MineCraft Plugins</h3>
        <section class="project" id="project4" onclick="location.href = 'https://github.com/ItsDoctorLeaf/plugin-rpCharacters'">
            <h1>Character Creations</h1>
            <h3>A Roleplay Character Creator for MineCraft Java</h3>
            <p>
                This is a java plugin where you create your own Roleplay characters. It was made to be used for a server, which never ended up being created. In this plugin, you can create your own custom roleplay characters with names and genders. You can search for people's real name and roleplay names and can ban certain phrases from being used as RP names.

            <h1>Chaos Plugin</h1>
            <h3>A Chaotic Plugin for MineCraft Java 1.20</h3>
            <p>
                The chaos plugin is inspired by the GTA V chaos mod. I wanted to create a similar sort of chaotic event, whilst making it easy to use. The chaos plugin doesn't use mods, and instead runs server side, making it easy to implement and work well for multiplayer. I created over 40 custom events that range from spawning a couple of enemies, summoning lighting around the player, and explosions... lots of explosions.
